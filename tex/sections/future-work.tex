\section{Future work}\label{sec:future-work}

The main goals of this paper were the creation of a dataset for \gls{ner} within the domain of assembly operations along with the testing of the effectiveness of state of the art \gls{ner} systems for tagging / extraction of the intended textual entities. Future work would include the development of a system capable of build on top of a given \gls{ner} processing pipeline and create the assembly graph containing in each node the installation of a given part with associated metadata, such as the tools required, its relative position in relation to already assembled parts and other information that may be useful to other higher level systems (for example the part ID, its dimensions and weight along with other related information, such as the torque necessary to apply when performing mating / screwing operations). Moreover, it would be useful to manually annotate the remaining of the dataset and add other types of assembly operations in order to broaden the scope of the presented corpus.
